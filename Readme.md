# Backend Server for Threads

This project is a demonstration of GraphQL APIs, focusing on creating the backend for a threads-based application. Built with Express.js, this backend server utilizes PostgreSQL for data storage and Docker Compose for easy PostgreSQL installation. The project includes continuous server restart functionality using `tsc-watch` and employs Prisma for schema management.

## Features

- **GraphQL APIs**: Demonstrates the use of GraphQL for API development.
- **Express.js**: Utilizes the Express.js framework for building the backend server.
- **PostgreSQL**: Uses PostgreSQL as the database for storing data.
- **Docker Compose**: Simplifies PostgreSQL setup and management.
- **Continuous Server Restart**: Implements `tsc-watch` for continuous server restarts during development.
- **Prisma**: Uses Prisma for database schema management and migrations.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amijugjug/threads-backend-gql.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up PostgreSQL with Docker Compose**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Generate Prisma Client**:
   ```bash
   yarn prisma generate
   ```

### Development

To start the development server with continuous restarts, use the following command:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This command uses `tsc-watch`, a TypeScript compiler wrapper that watches for file changes and automatically restarts the server. This is particularly useful for a smooth development experience as it ensures that the server is always running the latest code changes.

### Prisma

Prisma is used for database schema management. To apply schema changes and migrations, use the following commands:

- **Generate Prisma Client**:

  ```bash
  yarn prisma generate
  ```

- **Run migrations**:
  ```bash
  yarn prisma migrate dev
  ```
